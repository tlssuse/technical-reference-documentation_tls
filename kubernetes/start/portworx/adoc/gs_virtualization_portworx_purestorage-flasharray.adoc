== Introduction

As organizations increasingly adopt cloud-native and containerized workloads, the demand for robust, enterprise-grade storage solutions in virtualized environments continues to grow.
SUSE Virtualization, powered by Harvester and Kubernetes, delivers a flexible platform for running both virtual machines and modern containerized applications on a unified infrastructure.
To unlock advanced storage features and ensure seamless data management across diverse environments, integrating Portworx Enterprise brings unparalleled benefits—ranging from high availability and data protection to hybrid cloud mobility and multi-cluster support.

In this document administrators and platform engineers learn how to deploy, configure, and validate a SUSE Virtualization environment with Portworx Enterprise and Pure Storage FlashArray, enabling them to deliver resilient, scalable, and efficient storage services for mission-critical workloads in virtualized and cloud-native environments.

This integrated solution addresses a wide range of scenarios, including:

* Application Modernization: Seamlessly migrating or running legacy VM workloads and stateful cloud-native applications on the same infrastructure.
* Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Deployments: Enabling workload and data mobility across on-premises, public cloud, and edge locations.
* Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery: Providing robust backup, granular restore, and cross-site failover for both VMs and containers.
* Dev/Test and Self-Service Environments: Allowing developers to quickly provision persistent, production-grade storage for any workload type.
* Data-Intensive Workloads: Supporting databases, analytics, and AI/ML apps that require high availability and consistent performance.

== Prerequisites

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify minimum requirements (prerequisites) the reader
// would need in order to follow the steps of this guide.
// - Use an unordered list.
// - Use proper product names.
// - Identify product versions.
// - Link to existing resources whenever possible.
// - Keep this section brief but elaborate as needed.

== Procedure
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Detail the steps of the installation procedure.
// Replace 'Procedure' with one or more appropriate sections, such as:
// - 'Setting up the environment'
// - 'Installing the components'
// - 'Configuring and tuning'
// - 'Validating the deployment'
// You may find it useful to organize complex procedures into
// subsections.
//
// - As appropriate, make use of:
//   - Ordered lists for steps
//   - Code blocks for source code and console commands
//     Readers should be able to use copy and paste to leverage
//     commands and code in their environments
//   - Listing blocks for output
//   - Screenshots and diagrams
//   - Admonitions (notes, tips, warnings, etc.)
//
// NOTE: Always include some validation or verification in your guide.
